# Authentication React App - Functionality

This document provides an overview of the core functionality of the Authentication React App, which utilizes Firebase for authentication.

## User Registration

- **Registration Form**: Users can sign up for an account by providing a valid email address.
- **Email Confirmation**: After registration, an email confirmation link is sent to the provided email address.
- **Verified Users Only**: Only users who click the confirmation link in their email can log in.
- **Password Requirement**: Users are required to provide a password with a minimum of 6 characters containing 1 digit.

## User Login

- **Login Form**: Registered users can log in by entering their email address and password.
- **Authentication**: Firebase handles user authentication by verifying their credentials.
- **Session Management**: Successful login results in the creation of a user session, allowing access to protected routes.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid login attempts are handled with appropriate error messages.

## Protected Route

- **Route Guarding**: Certain routes are protected and require authentication to access.
- **Redirect**: If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected route, they are redirected to the login page.
- **Authorized Access**: Authenticated users can access protected routes, ensuring that sensitive content is secure.

## Basic User Profile

- **User Information**: Authenticated users can view basic information about their profile.
- **Personalization**: User profiles can be extended to include additional information or preferences as needed.
- **Profile Editing**: Users may have the option to edit and update their profile information (if implemented).

## Logout Functionality

- **Logout Button**: Authenticated users can log out of their account.
- **Session Termination**: Logging out destroys the user session, requiring reauthentication to access protected routes.
- **Security**: Proper logout ensures that the user's session is terminated securely.

## Firebase Authentication

- **Firebase Integration**: This app utilizes Firebase for user authentication.
- **Secure Authentication**: Firebase provides a secure and reliable authentication system.
- **User Management**: Firebase allows for easy user management, including registration and login.
